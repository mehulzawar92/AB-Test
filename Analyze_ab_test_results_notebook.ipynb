As a final check, assure you meet all the criteria on the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).\n",

    "We assumed that the null hypothesis is true. With that, we assume that p_old >= p_new, so both pages have the same converting rates over the whole sample. Therefore we also assume, that the individual converting probability of each page is equal to the one of the whole sample. Based on that, we bootstrapped a sampling distribution for both pages and calculated the differences in the converting probability per page with n equal to the original number of people who received each page. With the resulting standard deviation of the differences (which is coming from the simulated population), we then calcualted values coming from a normal distribution around 0. As last step we calculated the proportion of values which are bigger than the actually observed difference. The calculated p-value now tells us the probability of receiving this observed statistic if the null hypothesis is true. With a Type-I-Error-Rate of 0.05, we can say that 0.9062 > 0.05, therefore we don't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and we fail to reject the Null Hypothesis."
